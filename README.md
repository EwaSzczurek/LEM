Linear Effects Model
This is the source package for an enhanced version of the Linear Effects Model, 
(Linear effects models of signaling pathways from combinatorial perturbation data
E Szczurek, N Beerenwinkel Bioinformatics 32 (12), i297-i305). 
This version allows for both positive and negaive contributions of the genes to the phenotype.
